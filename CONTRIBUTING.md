Please sign [the Contributor License Agreement](https://cla-assistant.io/PG85/OpenTerrainGenerator).

## Pull Requests

For pull requests:

- You MUST: own the code you submit OR it must be free/open/safe to use (like code in the public domain). Code gathered
  from within any open source OpenTerrainGenerator project is valid to include here as well.
    - If your code is under any pre-existing license, you MUST note it in the pull request.
    - It is preferred that you contribute code that you own the rights to (generally, original code that you have
      written) rather than code licensed from another project.
- Any and all code you submit is subject to the mini-license below.
- In general, you should confirm your PR is functional in any ways that it may vary.
    - For example, if your code adds an NMS call, it should be tested for the version of the branch it is submitted to.
- USUALLY, your pull request should fix an open issue or feature request made in a Discord thread.
    - If there is no issue or thread for it, please open a thread.
- Team OTG reserves the right to refuse Pull Requests for any reason, although reasonable efforts will be made to
  accommodate appropriate requests.

## Code Style / Formatting

Match the general format/style of existing code within the project. Additional details on conventions will be added to
this document.

## Mini-license pre-warning

By contributing to the project, you give up all rights to your contribution\*.

If you later decide you don't want us using your code - you may make a polite request and it will be treated as such,
but that is the extent of your abilities.

\* This does not include your rights to continue making use of any involved code yourself, which you of course may
continue to do. You give up specifically your rights to the contribution *within this project*. Or to put it another
way: your rights to the specific copy of the contribution that is now contained within this project, as specifically
opposed to ideas and/or expressions thereof within the code or other work contributed, which you remain free to do with
as you wish (excluding actions that conflict with our ownership of the copy given to us).

### You agree by contributing:

- That you have read and agree to this document.
- To not attempt to "revoke rights to your code" or any similar action.
- That you have the right to publicly contribute any assets/code given. No contributing someone else's code without
  their permission.
- That the code submitted is either your own work, dedicated now to this project, OR it is under a license specified
  directly in the contribution.
